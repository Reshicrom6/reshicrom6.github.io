      <section>
        <h3>
          <a href="https://store.google.com/?hl=en-US&pli=1">Google Store</a>
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            C: The website uses a consistently soft palette of colors, which
            does make the site nice to look at. However, there are some sections
            of the website with content that are related, but because of a
            difference in background colors, they feel separate.
          </li>
          <li>
            R: The website uses a consistent box shape for all content, which
            creates an organized layout.
          </li>
          <li>
            A: Generally good, however, I found one issue in the "Discover the
            world of Pixel." section where the arrows to navigate the carousel
            of images was not vertically centered with the carousel like the
            other carousels on the page. Instead, it was centered with the
            section. This made the arrows feel just a bit off.
          </li>
          <li>P: The website is comprised of distinct sections of content.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3><a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/">Yale School Of Art</a></h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            C: It's definitely contrasty. The entire website is comprised of
            boxes, and each one has a different color.
          </li>
          <li>
            R: The only thing consitent about the layout is that all content is
            separated into different boxes, but the border size, text size, and
            margins are all different.
          </li>
          <li>
            A: The alignment is all over the place, as well as being relegated
            purely to the left side of my screen. There is no content beyond
            around the left 30% of the screen beyond the background image.
          </li>
          <li>
            P: The nicest thing about the layout of the website is that all
            content is separated into visually distinct boxes.
          </li>
        </ul>
